1. Get the user details / use the demo user
2. Get user to select the project / a demo project
3. Open the project
4. Start the http server to get analytics (basic info initially)
5. Start the dashboard server


The user will automatically be logged out after 30 mins, or the time set in the config_file.

The API server will shutdown gracefully after the expiry time is over.



AX Monitor has a demo mode in which user can open one project, which is deleted after the session ends

This it to try out AX Monitor.

Otherwise a user can be created, and stored in the users table

+----------+----------+---------+
| username | password | user_id |
+----------+----------+---------+

This table can be queried to find projects related to the user.

The AX Monitor uses tables to store the APIs to be added by a person

For this, the user needs to create a project and import the json file with a list of APIs

After that, these APIs are registered in the database and the user can choose which project to monitor 
its APIs.

ax_monitor start -> login -> select project / import project -> open dashboard

+---------+------------+---------+
| project | project_id | user_id |
+---------+------------+---------+
